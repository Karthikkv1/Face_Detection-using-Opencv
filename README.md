# Face Detection using OpenCV

This Python project utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection through webcam capture. It detects faces in the captured video stream and draws rectangles around the detected faces.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes webcam capture to detect faces in real-time.
- **Accuracy**: Employs the Haar Cascade classifier for accurate face detection.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface to visualize the face detection process.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the OpenCV library:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main program using Python:
   ```
   python face_detection.py
   ```
2. Ensure your webcam is connected and working properly.
3. The application will open a window displaying the webcam feed with rectangles drawn around detected faces.
4. Press the 'ESC' key to exit the application.
